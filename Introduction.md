# Introduction

LLMs have been transforming the way we process and manipulate language over the past few years.
They are the revolution of Natural Language Processing. These deep neural networks are cabaple of more complex tasks, such as summarization, parsing complex data and answering complex questions.

The power of LLMs comes from both the vast amount of data they were trained on and the transformer architecture [1].
